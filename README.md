# YouTube Clone (HTML + CSS)
This is a front-end clone of the YouTube homepage, developed using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the visual structure of YouTube, including the sidebar, top navigation bar, and a grid of video previews. This project focuses on layout and styling, making it a great learning exercise for mastering Flexbox, CSS positioning, and responsive design.

# How It Works
1. Header Section
A fixed top navigation bar that remains at the top of the screen while scrolling.

Contains:

Hamburger menu icon

YouTube logo

Search bar in the center

User action icons (voice search, upload, apps, notifications, and profile) on the right

2. Sidebar (Left Menu)
A vertically fixed menu aligned to the left side of the page.

Contains clickable icons and labels like:

Home

Explore

Subscriptions

Originals

YouTube Music

Library

Sidebar remains fixed while scrolling through the videos.

3. Main Content Area
Displays a grid of video preview cards similar to the YouTube homepage.

Each video card includes:

A thumbnail image

A channel profile picture

Video title

Channel name

View count and upload time

The layout is responsive using Flexbox and flex-wrap, allowing cards to wrap into the next row as needed.

# Features
Fixed Header: Always visible at the top, improving navigation.

Fixed Sidebar: Allows constant access to main categories while browsing.

Responsive Grid Layout: Video previews adjust based on screen width.

Clean Typography: Uses Google Fonts (Roboto) for a modern UI.
